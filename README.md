## github flow description

Github Flow is a lightweight, branch-based git workflow.

The main concepts I will be adressing here are these:

- the main (prod) branch
- the dev (develop) branch
- feature branches
- hotfix branches
- why we use squash when we do feature -> dev prs
- why we use merge when we use dev -> main prs
